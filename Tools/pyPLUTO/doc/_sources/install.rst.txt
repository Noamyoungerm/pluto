Installation
===============================

The latest version of the *pyPLUTO* code is officially distributed with the 
latest version (4.4) of the *PLUTO* code. This can be downloaded from PlutoDownload_.

.. _PlutoDownload: http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/Download.html 

The current version of *pyPLUTO* has been updated to support Python version 3 and is tested with >3.6.

1. **Global Install**

 The Python version from the EPD version by default creates a PYTHONPATH. If no option is chosen for preferred path
 then in that case the code will be installed in that default path.  This may require the user to have access to the r  oot password:

 - Enter into the directory : ``cd $PLUTO_DIR/Tools/pyPLUTO``
 - Install the code in the default path : ``python setup.py install``

2. **Local Install (Recommended)**

 The best practice is to create your own PYTHONPATH and do a local install in the following way:

 - Create a directory where to store this module : ``mkdir MyPython_Modules``
 - Enter into the directory : ``cd $PLUTO_DIR/Tools/pyPLUTO``
 - Install the code in the directory created : ``python setup.py install --prefix=<path to MyPython_Modules>``
 - Then append the following in your .bashrc : 
    ``export PYTHONPATH =<path to MyPython_Modules>/lib/python<ver>/site-packages``
  
    ``export PATH =<path to MyPython_Modules>/bin:$PATH``

 where <ver> is the python version which the user have used to install the package.
  

 *GUI is only supported with the pyPLUTO version with Python 2*
